# Black-Scholes
Comptuing Option Prices in C++


This is just a draft of a library I am creating to price options for fun in my free time and to practice some c++ coding.
For now, it contains code to price FX options but my aim is to add functions to price American, European and Exotic Options.
I wanted to test three different ways to price options: discrete method/ black scholes, monte carlo simulation, euler discretization and with a binomial model.
